# 📘 Model Context Protocol (MCP) 

---

## 🚀 1. Introduction

This document explains **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** in very simple English with deep understanding.

MCP is becoming very popular and may become an **industry standard in the next 3–5 years**. fileciteturn0file0

---

## 🤖 2. Arrival of LLMs (ChatGPT Revolution)

* ChatGPT launched on **30 Nov 2022**
* 1 million users in 5 days
* 100 million users in 2 months fileciteturn0file0

### 💡 What changed?

Earlier:

* Humans → Machines (buttons, commands)
* Interaction was **transactional**

Now:

* Humans ↔ AI (natural language)
* Interaction is **conversational**

👉 You can talk to AI like a human.

---

## 🌊 3. Three Waves of AI Adoption

### 1️⃣ Wave 1: Curiosity Phase

* People asked fun/random questions
* Example:

  * "Explain physics like a cat"
  * "Write song about pizza"

👉 Goal: Explore AI

---

### 2️⃣ Wave 2: Professional Use

People started using AI for real work:

* Lawyers → summarize contracts
* Developers → debug code
* Teachers → create curriculum

👉 Result: **Productivity increased**

---

### 3️⃣ Wave 3: API Revolution

* Companies started integrating AI in software
* Examples:

  * MS Word, Excel → Copilot
  * Google Docs, Gmail → AI features

👉 AI became **everywhere**

---

## ⚠️ 4. Problem: Fragmentation

Now many AI tools exist:

* Notion AI
* Slack AI
* VS Code AI
* ChatGPT

### ❌ Problem:

These tools **do not talk to each other**

👉 Result:

* Information is scattered
* You must switch tools again and again

---

## 🎯 5. Vision vs Reality

### Vision:

One **Unified AI Agent** that:

* Understands all your work
* Solves everything

### Reality:

* Multiple AI tools
* No connection between them

👉 Main challenge = **Context Problem**

---

## 🧠 6. What is Context?

### Simple Definition:

> Context = All information AI can see while generating answer fileciteturn0file0

### Example:

If you ask:

1. What is Quantum Physics?
2. Is it difficult?

👉 AI understands question 2 using previous conversation

➡️ That previous chat = **Context**

---

## 🔥 7. Real-World Context (Complex Case)

Example: Software Engineer building feature

Context exists in:

* Jira → task
* GitHub → code
* Database → schema
* Google Drive → docs
* Slack → discussions

👉 Context is **spread across tools**

---

## 😵 8. The Big Problem: Copy-Paste Hell

To use AI:

* Copy Jira → paste
* Copy code → paste
* Copy DB schema → paste
* Copy docs → paste

👉 Takes 20+ minutes just to ask 1 question

### ❌ Problems:

* Time waste
* Not scalable
* Humans become “manual API”

---

## ⚙️ 9. Solution Attempt: Function Calling

### Idea:

Let AI call functions (tools)

Example:

```python
load_file("abc.txt")
```

### How it works:

1. Provide functions to AI
2. AI chooses correct function
3. Function executes task

👉 AI can now **perform actions, not just chat**

---

## 🛠️ 10. Rise of Tools

Different tools created:

* Weather API
* Database queries
* GitHub access
* Web search

👉 AI connects with tools → fetch context automatically

---

## ✅ 11. Improvement with Tools

Now instead of copy-paste:

You say:

* "Fetch Jira ticket"
* "Get code from GitHub"

👉 AI collects context automatically

---

## 🚨 12. New Problem: Integration Hell

If:

* n chatbots
* m tools

👉 You need = **n × m integrations**

### Problems:

* Too much coding
* Hard maintenance
* Security issues
* High cost

---

## 💡 13. Final Solution: MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Core Idea:

Standard way for AI and tools to communicate

---

## 🏗️ 14. MCP Architecture

### Two components:

1. **Client** → AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Cursor)
2. **Server** → Tools (GitHub, Slack, DB)

👉 Communication happens using MCP protocol

---

## 🔄 15. How MCP Works

* AI connects to servers
* Servers provide tools + data
* No manual coding needed in client

👉 Server does all heavy work

---

## ⚖️ 16. MCP vs Function Calling

| Feature     | Function Calling | MCP              |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Code needed | Yes              | No (client side) |
| Integration | Manual           | Standard         |
| Scalability | Poor             | High             |
| Maintenance | High             | Low              |

---

## 🎁 17. Benefits of MCP

### ✅ 1. Fewer Integrations

From:

* n × m → many integrations

To:

* m + n → much fewer

---

### ✅ 2. No Maintenance

* Server handles updates
* Client unchanged

---

### ✅ 3. Faster Development

* Connect directly to servers
* No need to build integrations

---

### ✅ 4. Better Security

* Central config (JSON)
* Easier to manage

---

## 🌍 18. Why MCP is Growing Fast

* AI tools support MCP
* Companies forced to adapt
* Ecosystem growing fast

👉 Likely future standard

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

* AI needs **context** to work properly
* Context is scattered across tools
* Tools solved it partially
* But created integration problem

👉 MCP solves this by:

* Standardizing communication
* Reducing complexity
* Making AI truly powerful

---

## 🧠 What is Data Layer?

![Data Layer](https://opsi.org/en/blog/opsi-cli-jsonrpc/header.jpg)
![JSON Structure](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ff66329429d880392f6cba2/676ff01bb48efc129a28b29d_61b76e7fdf48bbef0026f39a_JSON%2520works.png)

👉 Data Layer = Language used for communication between Client and Server

* Defines rules (grammar)
* Defines structure of messages

📌 In MCP → Data Layer uses **JSON-RPC 2.0**

---

## 🔗 What is RPC?

![RPC](https://www.altexsoft.com/media/2020/05/word-image-54.png)

👉 RPC = Remote Procedure Call

Simple meaning:

> Call a function on another machine like it's local

Example:

Instead of:

```
add(2, 3)
```

You send request:

```
Run "add" with parameters 2 and 3
```

---

## 🔗 What is JSON-RPC?

![JSON RPC Flow](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320078730/figure/fig5/AS%3A543639655141377%401506625202361/An-example-of-JSON-RPC-response.png)

👉 JSON-RPC = RPC + JSON format

* RPC → calling remote functions
* JSON → structure of message

---

## 🧾 JSON-RPC Request Structure

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "add",
  "params": {
    "a": 2,
    "b": 3
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Explanation:

* `jsonrpc` → version
* `method` → function name
* `params` → inputs
* `id` → match request & response

---

## 🧾 JSON-RPC Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 5,
  "id": 1
}
```

---

## ❌ Error Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Method not found"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

---

## ⚡ JSON-RPC in MCP (Important)

👉 All communication between Client & Server uses JSON-RPC

Example:

### tools/list

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/list",
  "id": 1
}
```

### tools/call

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "list_issues"
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

---

## 🔥 Advanced Features of JSON-RPC

### 1. Batch Requests

![Batch](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv8k!,f_auto,q_auto\:good,fl_progressive\:steep/https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/362128ff-7821-482e-b08a-8252d0faab99_1200x1200.png)

👉 Send multiple requests at once

---

### 2. Notifications

👉 No response required

* Fire and forget
* No `id` field

---

## 🚀 Why JSON-RPC over REST?

| Feature      | JSON-RPC | REST          |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| Endpoint     | Single   | Multiple URLs |
| Format       | JSON     | JSON/XML      |
| Overhead     | Low      | High          |
| Batch        | Yes      | No            |
| Notification | Yes      | No            |

---

## 🧠 Transport Layer

![Transport](https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs44163-024-00134-3/MediaObjects/44163_2024_134_Fig2_HTML.png)

👉 Transport Layer = How messages travel

* Moves JSON-RPC messages
* Client ↔ Server communication medium

---

## 🔀 Types of Servers

### 1. Local Server

![Local](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize\:fit:1200/1-5gFJX9g0nVddOZXS6AMDDA.png)

* Runs on same machine
* Example: file system access

---

### 2. Remote Server

![Remote](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize\:fit:1400/1-6Xn1NsZM3Rp3XIanFkFJxQ.png)

* Runs on internet
* Example: GitHub API

---

## ⚙️ Transport for Local Server → STDIO

![STDIO](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240206154107/Standard-Input-Output.webp)

👉 STDIO = Standard Input Output

### How it works:

1. Host starts server as subprocess
2. Host sends data via stdin
3. Server sends response via stdout

---

## 💡 Example (Python)

```python
name = input("Enter name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

👉 Input → stdin
👉 Output → stdout

---

## 🚀 Benefits of STDIO

* ⚡ Fast (same machine)
* 🔒 Secure (no network)
* 🧩 Simple implementation

---

## 🌐 Transport for Remote Server → HTTP + SSE

![HTTP](https://www.altexsoft.com/media/2020/05/word-image-54.png)
![SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events/streaming.png)

### HTTP

* Used to send requests
* Uses POST request
* JSON payload

---

### SSE (Server-Sent Events)

👉 Used for streaming responses

* Server sends data continuously
* One connection, multiple messages

---

## 🔥 Why SSE?

* Real-time updates
* Streaming AI responses
* Long-running tasks

---

## 🧠 Important Concept

👉 JSON-RPC is **transport-agnostic**

Means:

* Works with STDIO
* Works with HTTP
* Works with WebSockets

---

## 🔥 Final Summary

* Data Layer → JSON-RPC
* Transport Layer → message delivery

### Local Server:

* Uses STDIO

### Remote Server:

* Uses HTTP + SSE

---

## 🎯 Key Insight

👉 MCP separates:

* Data Layer (language)
* Transport Layer (delivery)

➡️ This makes system flexible and scalable

# MCP Lifecycle – Simple English Notes (Detailed)

---

## 📌 Introduction

This document explains the **MCP Lifecycle** in very simple English with full detail and examples.

👉 MCP Lifecycle means how **Client and Server connect, communicate, and disconnect** step by step.

---

## 🧠 What is MCP Lifecycle?

**Definition:**
MCP Lifecycle is the **complete sequence of steps** that explains how:

* Connection is created
* Communication happens
* Connection ends

📌 fileciteturn0file0

---

## 🔗 What is a Session?

A **session** is a continuous connection between:

* Client (Host)
* Server

### Example:

* Claude Desktop = Client
* GitHub MCP Server = Server

👉 When you start Claude Desktop:

* It connects to server automatically
* Connection stays active until you close it

That continuous connection = **Session**

---

## 🔄 MCP Lifecycle Phases

There are **3 main phases**:

1. Initialization Phase
2. Operation Phase
3. Shutdown Phase

---

# 🟢 1. Initialization Phase (Handshake Phase)

👉 This is the **first interaction** between client and server.

### Purpose:

* Check compatibility
* Exchange capabilities
* Establish connection

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Process

### 🔹 Step 1: Client → Server (Initialize Request)

Client sends a request to server:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {},
      "sampling": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "client-app",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 📌 What client sends:

* Protocol version
* Capabilities (what it can do)
* Client info

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Server → Client (Response)

Server replies with:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-10-01",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": {},
      "resources": {}
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "filesystem-server",
      "version": "2.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 📌 What server sends:

* Protocol version
* Capabilities
* Server info

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Client → Server (Initialized Notification)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "initialized"
}
```

👉 This means:

* Connection is successful
* Communication can start

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### Rule 1:

Client cannot send other requests before initialization completes

### Rule 2:

Server also cannot respond with other data before "initialized"

👉 Only allowed:

* Ping
* Logs

---

# 🔄 Version Negotiation

👉 What if versions are different?

### Process:

1. Client checks server version
2. Compares with supported versions
3. If supported → continue
4. If not → disconnect

---

# 🤝 Capability Negotiation

👉 Client and server tell each other:
**"What I can do"**

---

## 🧩 Client Capabilities

### 1. Roots

* Give access to file system

### 2. Sampling

* Server can use client’s AI

### 3. Elicitation

* Server asks for missing info

---

## 🧩 Server Capabilities

### 1. Tools

* Functions that client can use

### 2. Resources

* Static data (files/docs)

### 3. Prompts

* Instructions/templates

### 4. Logging

* Send updates during long tasks

---

## 🔔 Sub-Capabilities

### 1. list_changed

* Notify when tools/resources change

### 2. subscribe

* Get updates when resource changes

---

# 🟡 2. Operation Phase

👉 This is the **main working phase**

### What happens:

* Client sends requests
* Server processes them
* Server sends responses

---

## Example Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools.call",
  "params": {
    "name": "createFile",
    "arguments": {
      "path": "test.txt"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Rules:

* Use agreed protocol version
* Use only negotiated capabilities

---

# 🔴 3. Shutdown Phase

👉 Ending the session

### When happens:

* Client closes app
* Server stops

---

## Example

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "shutdown"
}
```

---

# 💻 Practical Understanding

👉 Example setup:

* Client: Claude Desktop
* Server: File System MCP Server

### What server can do:

* Read files
* Create files
* Modify files

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* MCP works in **3 phases**
* Initialization = handshake
* Operation = real work
* Shutdown = connection end
* JSON-RPC is used for communication

---

## 🚀 Final Summary

MCP Lifecycle =

1. Connect (Initialization)
2. Communicate (Operation)
3. Disconnect (Shutdown)

---

✔ This lifecycle is very important for building:

* MCP Servers
* MCP Clients
* AI Agent Systems

---

🔥 Now you are ready to implement MCP in real projects!
